## Data problems with The Equity

In the list of names, it appears there is duplication where we want uniqueness

*Shawn Graham
Shawn Hackney Society Junior
Shawn I
<---snip--->
Shawn Gra
Shawn Gra- McCorriston
Shawn Gra-Principal
*Shawn Graham
Shawn Graham Bristol
Shawn Graham Class

In reviewing this data, some names are separated by horizatal tabs (ASCII character 9) and others by spaces (character 32)

This query returns a result:
select name  FROM corpus_entities.entities_people where name like concat('Shawn',char(9),'Graham');

This query shows over 21,000 names that have tabs in the data, which we don't want

select name, count(*) FROM corpus_entities.entities_people where instr(name,char(9));

We can't run this:

UPDATE corpus_entities.entities_people SET name = REPLACE(name, char(9), char(32)) where name like concat('Shawn',char(9),'Graham');

Because the name column is unique and there is already a name in there called Shawn Graham.

Solution: re-run the program and strip out the tabs
