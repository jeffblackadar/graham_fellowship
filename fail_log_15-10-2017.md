## content being misinterpreted as html

Some data had less than signs < that can be interpreted as the start of an html tag, like below

OOW<i

Page content after this appeared in italics because the <i signified to a web browser the start of the &lt;i&gt; italic html tag.  This is fixed with 

str_replace("<","&lt;",$row['ent_name'])

Using the php function htmlspecialchars resulted in a lot of data just not being returned by the function.  The above seems to be the least harmful way to do this.

## accents in content mishandled

Was getting out put like:

Carmen Burke Pr�sidente

But the the database had

Carmen Burke Présidente

Setting the character set in the database connection fixed that, per below.  I should have checked that all accented characters were being stored in the database properly from the start.  I'm glad it appears they were. Will need to check that.

mysql_set_charset('utf8',$link);

## Full text index

Added full text index called ftname to entities_people, entities_organizations and entities_locations
