#British Gazette
I want to pull some info from the British Gazette

Here is the API

https://github.com/TheGazette/DevDocs/blob/master/notice/notice-feed.md

I think I can use the API to search, pull in results, deal with those results and get some insight.

I'm looking at allotment gardens

One I pull this in I can use R for NLP to get name and location of allotments?

I think I want this data as json

According to

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2617600/importing-data-from-a-json-file-into-r

I should use rjson (although there are other libraries too.)

install.packages("rjson")
